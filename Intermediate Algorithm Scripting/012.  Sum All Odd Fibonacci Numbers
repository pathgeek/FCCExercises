Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers

Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.
The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the 
sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.
For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.
------------
function sumFibs(num) {
  return num;
}

sumFibs(4);
------------
function sumFibs(num) {
  var previousNumber = 0;
  var currentNumber = 1;
  var result = 0;
  while (currentNumber <=num){
    if (currentNumber %2 !==0){
      result += currentNumber;
    }
    currentNumber += previousNumber;
    previousNumber = currentNumber - previousNumber;
  }
  return result;
}

sumFibs(4);
