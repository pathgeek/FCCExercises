Diff Two Arrays


Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the 
two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of 
the two arrays.

Note: You can return the array with its elements in any order.
 My notes:
    1Check: they’re the same object type (array vs. object).
    2Check: have the same number of items.
    3Check: each item is equal to its counterpart in the other array or object.
    4Check:  they’re the same object type (array vs. object vs. string vs. number vs. function).
    5Check:  they have the same value.
    
function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
  let difference = arr1
                 .filter(x => !arr2.includes(x))
                 .concat(arr2.filter(x => !arr1.includes(x)));
  return difference; 
  // Same, same; but different.
  }

diffArray([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
