Seek and Destroy

You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), 
followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that are of 
the same value as these arguments.

Note: You have to use the arguments object.


  /* Put all arguments in an array using spread operator and remove elements 
     starting from 1 */
  const args = [...arguments].splice(1);
  /* Check whether arguments include elements from an array and return all that 
     do not include(false) */
  return arr.filter(el => !args.includes(el));
}
