Smallest Common Multiple


Smallest Common Multiple

Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that can be evenly divided 
by both, as well as by all sequential numbers in the range between these parameters.
The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order.
For example, if given 1 and 3, find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is also
evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3. The answer here would be 6.

-------------------------------
function smallestCommons(arr) {
  arr.sort(function(a,b){
    //sort array from greatest to smallest
    return b-a;
  });
// create new array, add values of original array from greatest to smallest
var newArray= [];
for(var i = arr[0]; i>=arr[1]; i--){
  newArray.push(i);
}
// variables for outside the loops
var quot = 0;
var loop = 1;
var n;

// code if n != array.length
do {
  quot = newArray[0] * loop * newArray[1];
  for (n=2; n<newArray.length; n++){
    if(quot % newArray[n] !== 0){
      break;
    }
  }
  loop ++;
} while (n !== newArray.length);
  return quot;
}
