You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like this:
              [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]].
This is also called a Multi-dimensional Array.
Instructions: Create a nested array called myArray.
            myArray should have at least one array nested within another array.

            // Example
            var ourArray = [["the universe", 42], ["everything", 101010]];

            // Only change code below this line.
                  var myArray = [[1, "forty-two"], 1];
