We will now use our knowledge of strings to build a "Mad Libs" style word
game we're calling "Word Blanks". You will create an (optionally humorous)
"Fill in the Blanks" style sentence.

You will need to use string operators to build a new string, result, using
the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb.

You will also need to use additional strings, which will not change, and
must be in between all of the provided words. The output should be a
complete sentence.

We have provided a framework for testing your results with different words.
The tests will run your function with several different inputs to make sure
all of the provided words appear in the output, as well as your extra strings.
wordBlanks("","","","") should return a string.

  wordBlanks("dog", "big", "ran", "quickly") should contain all of the passed
  in words separated by non-word characters (and any additional words in your
  madlib).
  wordBlanks("cat", "little", "hit", "slowly") should contain all of the
  passed in words separated by non-word characters (and any additional words
  in your madlib).
  function wordBlanks(myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, myAdverb) {
  var result = "";
  // Your code below this line
          result += myNoun +' ' +myAdjective+' ' +myVerb+' ' +myAdverb;

  // Your code above this line
  return result;
}

// Change the words here to test your function
  wordBlanks("dog", "big", "ran", "quickly");
