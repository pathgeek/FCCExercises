With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one
place. You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it
with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

        var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

Instructions: Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a
string and a number (in that order).

Hint:Refer to the example code in the text editor if you get stuck.
          myArray should be an array.
          The first item in myArray should be a string.
          The second item in myArray should be a number.

          // Example
          var ourArray = ["John", 23];

          // Only change code below this line.
                    var myArray = ["Here", 33];
