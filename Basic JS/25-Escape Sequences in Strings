Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string.
Here is a table of common escape sequences:
        Code	Output
        \'	single quote
        \"	double quote
        \\	backslash
        \n	newline
        \r	carriage return
        \t	tab
        \b	backspace
        \f	form feed
Note that the backslash itself must be escaped in order to display as
a backslash.

Instructions:Assign the following three lines of text into the single
variable myStr using escape sequences.
          FirstLine
          \SecondLine\
          ThirdLine
You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly.
You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces
between escape sequences or words.
Here is the text with the escape sequences written out.
